This is an attempt to recreate the Color flipper javascript project from https://www.vanillajavascriptprojects.com/ without watching the video or copying the code.

I know there are a few ways to specify color in CSS
english, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color_keywords
 * #rgb, 
 * #rrggbb,
 * rgb(a,b,c), 
 * rgba(a,b,c,d), 
 * hsl(a,b,c),
 * hsla(a,b,c,d)
 * hwb
 * lch
 * lab coordinate system

 some of these do not work yet. I've also read that there is an 
 #RRGGBBAA color type

 should allow for user input

 and changes the display style
